## Conclusion

## Other

The study of this project ended in August 2018. This is because satisfactory results came out and it was no longer meaningful to proceed with the project. The project could be implemented using a library such as Tensorflow, but it was implemented in CUDA C because I was curious about the internal structure of the GPU. To practice how neural networks work, I chose the CUDA C programming language. After programming and debugging my code, I was able to improve my understanding of deep neural networks by implementing forwarding, backpropagation, and adam optimizer by myself.
